# Hand Gesture Recognition System
This project aims to develop a Hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

# Description
This project aims to develop a Deep Learning Model for Hand Gesture Recognition for gesture-based control systems. The model uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) Architecture to extract information from the images.
# Dataset
The dataset used here is **Hand Gesture Recognition Database** provided by gti-upm in Kaggle. Hand gesture recognition database is composed by a set of near infrared images acquired by the Leap Motion sensor. The database is composed by 10 different hand-gestures (showed above) that were performed by 10 different subjects (5 men and 5 women). The database, as a whole, consists of 20,000 annotated images, separated into folders based on the hand gesture and the subject performed.
